\usage{
augmentation(xf, xnf, yf)
}
\arguments{
\item{xf}{The matrix of financed clients' characteristics to be used in the scorecard.}

\item{xnf}{The matrix of not financed clients' characteristics to be used in the scorecard (must be the same features in the same order as xf!).}

\item{yf}{The matrix of financed clients' labels}
}
\value{
List containing the model using financed clients only and the model produced using the Augmentation method.
}
\description{
This function performs Reject Inference using the Augmentation technique. Note that this technique is theoretically better than using the financed clients scorecard in the MAR and misspecified model case.
}
\details{
This function performs the Augmentation method on the data. When provided with labeled observations \eqn{(x^\ell,y)}, it first fits the logistic regression model \eqn{p_\theta} of
\eqn{x^\ell} on \eqn{y}, then reweighs labeled observations according to their probability of being sampled, i.e. calculates the predicted probabilities of \eqn{p_\theta} on all observations, defines score-bands and calculates, in each of these score-bands, the probability of having been accepted as the proportion of labeled samples in that score-band.
It then refits a logistic regression model \eqn{p_\eta} on the labeled samples.
}
\examples{
# We simulate data from financed clients
df <- generate_data(n = 100, d = 2)
xf <- df[, -ncol(df)]
yf <- df$y
# We simulate data from not financed clients (MCAR mechanism)
xnf <- generate_data(n = 100, d = 2)[, -ncol(df)]
augmentation(xf, xnf, yf)
